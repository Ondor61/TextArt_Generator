# Text Art Generator

This is a Python script that converts images into ASCII art. It utilizes the PIL for image processing and tkinter for creating a user interface.

## Features

* Convert the image to ASCII art: The selected image is quickly processed to generate your AsciiArt.
* Complete UI: including file dialogs for opening and saving images.
* Adjust the color: Users can adjust the mid-tone point along with white and black points to fine tune the text_art to suit their needs.
* Display the ASCII art: The generated ASCII art is shown in a text canvas within the UI, allowing users to scroll both horizontally and vertically while also having the ability to change the font size.
* Save the ASCII art: Users can save the generated ASCII art as a text file.
